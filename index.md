#### What's DraxWare?
*   ᴅʀᴀx ᴡᴀʀᴇ Stands For
    
    (***D***)on't
    (***R***)epeat
    (***A***)nd
    (***X***)-ploit -> Exploit

    (***W***)in
    (***A***)bsolutely
    (***R***)are
    (***E***)*-Victories*

    Principal Points: ᴅʀᴀx ᴡᴀʀᴇ It is an all-purpose tool with these features. As: Esp, Aimbot, & Macros (Yes, This Aimbot Has Prediction Built In; I Took My 
    Time To Make Ai Prediction And Bac Prediction And Combine Them Both Into 1, Making ᴅʀᴀx ᴡᴀʀᴇ The Best One Out There); plus a lot more.

    ᴅʀᴀx ᴡᴀʀᴇ Information: 

    ᴅʀᴀx ᴡᴀʀᴇ Is Free :confetti:
    "On a shitbox, ᴅʀᴀx ᴡᴀʀᴇ doesn't cause any frame rate decreases for me. - User 0912"


    Unnamed-Esp and Ro-Ware are competitors of Drax Ware ( Developed By Such amazing scripters)

    In conclusion, neither Ro-Ware nor Unnamed esp were able to defeat ᴅʀᴀx ᴡᴀʀᴇ in the majority of games... in terms of 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 and 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 ( a lot of       games failed to pass the test of esp or esp and aimbot). ᴅʀᴀx ᴡᴀʀᴇ works in ALL video games. Within Roblox.
